# Loan_Approval_Predictor

This is a datascience project predicting the possibility of loan approval using the the inputs:

		Gender               
		Married               
		Dependents

		Loan_Amount_Term     
		Credit_History       
		Property_Area  
		
Data analysis and Claaning is done to the Dataset to fill in missing values

Conversion of categorical variable to numeric using Label Encoder for maximum optimization of all the data in the dataset 

Classification Algorithm like Decesion Tree and  Logistic Regrsssion is used to find the output of which Logistic Regression is the most optimum	which gives the accuracy of approximately 84%
